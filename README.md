# programming-project
The developed program allows consumers to measure their energy consumption and cost each month through an application. For the development of our project the dataset used was data concentrated on the energy consumption of an area in Paris over four years. Right from the start, there were some constraints regarding the actual data. To fix it there had to be some column elimination as well as measurement conversion, what proceeds is the actual displacement of the data. Users will have the ability to be aware of what the cost will look like for the end-of-the-month payment. Availability of an accurate prediction of energy consumption and cost for the period the user chooses to visualise. It is expected that all of these features will be completed, and users will be able to switch between the different window types and design the exact plot they want with the parameters they choose.

To run the program you have to download the whole folder and run the main.py file.
